# Javadoc
This directory contains autogenerated, autoupdated javadocs built from our source code using Github Actions. It is updated on a branch when it has an active PR to main, or when commits are made directly to main, so branches without existing PRs may have stale versions of the documentation.


To view, simply open the index.html file in one of the subfolders in a web browser, or visit a (usually working) hosted mirror of javadocs on the main branch [here](https://evaluator:ev@!uator@jdoc-3303.cbains.ca/)
